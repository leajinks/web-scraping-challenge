# web-scraping-challenge

In this repository, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a Mars news website (part 1) and a Mars temperature data website (part 2). 

Part 1 scrapes the header and descriptions from the Mars news homepage, providing a consolidated dictionary of recent news.

Part 2 scrapes table data from the Mars temperature data site, putting it into Pandas dataframes and visualizing data with Matplotlib.
